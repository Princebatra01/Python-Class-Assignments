    "#     Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit attributes\n",

    "#     Single inheritance refers to the ability of a class to inherit from a single superclass or base class.\n",
    "#     In single inheritance, a subclass extends and inherits the attributes and methods of a single superclass.\n",

    "#     of the superclass and can add its own unique features.\n",
